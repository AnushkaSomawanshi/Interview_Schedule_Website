# Interview_Schedule_Website
The Interview Scheduling System is a web-based application designed to simplify the interview scheduling process. It features a streamlined interface for recruiters and candidates, allowing easy management of interview queues, prioritization of candidates, and assignment to interview panels. The platform enables users to add candidates with details such as name, age, and experience, while offering dynamic queue management. Candidates are initially added to a linear queue and can be moved to a priority queue, which automatically sorts them based on their experience. Additionally, the system allows for assigning candidates to specific interview panels and managing their progression. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application boasts a responsive design and client-side functionality. To use the system, simply clone the repository, open the index.html file in a web browser, and start managing interviews seamlessly. Contributions to enhance the project are welcome, and the system is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for modifications and distribution as needed.
